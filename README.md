# TensorFlow Advanced Techniques

It is a series of notebooks about some “beyond the basics” or mid-advanced techniques with TensorFlow and Keras. 

It could be said that these notebooks pick up where the TensorFlow Developer Certified exam leaves off.

It is not a course or tutoria, just a colletion of notebooks and articles explaining some interesting techniques that you can use with TensorFlow and Keras. 

## Improve TensorFlow performance with Graps Mode. 
Using the *cats_vs_dogs* dataset we are going to explore hot to use the Graph Mode and how it can improve the performance in our Notebooks.

## Multiple Outputs with Keras Functional API. 
Using the functional API and a non sequential Model we are going to learn ho to create a model able to predict more than one variable. The Datased used is the *Wine_quality* and we will predict a Classification Variable to classify the wine, and a Regression variable to qualify the wine.
